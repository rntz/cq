There is no real installation procedure at the moment. Simply put cqd and cq
somewhere in your PATH.


Requirements
============

cq needs zsh to run. This is a known bug. I intend to fix it, but it is not high
priority. I will accept patches to this end, if they are correct and reasonably
concise.

cqd (and therefore cq) needs Python to run, at least version 2.5. This is not a
bug, and I will not fix it.

There are perhaps other trivial requirements I've missed. If you've been bitten
by the fact that one of them isn't mentioned here, email me or submit a patch
(either removing the dependency or changing this file).
