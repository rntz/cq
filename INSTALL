Installation
============

Edit config.mk to taste, then `make install'. By default, we install to
/usr/local, so you will need to be root to `make install'.


Requirements
============

- Python >= 2.5
- zsh (no idea what version)
- pod2man: used to generate the man page

cq needs zsh to run. This is a known bug. I intend to fix it, but it is not high
priority. I will accept patches to this end, if they are correct and reasonably
concise.

There may be other requirements I've missed. If you've been bitten by the fact
that one of them isn't mentioned here, email me or submit a patch (either
removing the dependency or changing this file).
