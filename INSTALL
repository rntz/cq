There is no real installation procedure at the moment. Simply `make', then put
cqd and cq somewhere in your PATH.

If you encounter problems running `make', your system probably doesn't support
some of the convenient but nonstandard features of GNU/Linux cqd uses. This is a
known bug. I intend to fix it, but it is not high priority. I will consider
accepting patches to this end.

cq needs zsh to run. This is another known bug.
